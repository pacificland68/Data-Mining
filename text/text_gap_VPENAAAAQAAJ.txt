writing the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire both in the west and the east The whole period ex tends from the age of Trajan and the Antonines to the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II and includes a review of the crusades and the state of Rome during the middle ages Since the publication of the first volume twelve years have elapsed twelve years according to my wish of health of leisure and of perseverance I may now congratulate my deliverance from a long and laborious service and my satis faction will be pure and perfect if the public favour should be extended to the conclusion of my work It was my first intention to have collected under one view the numerous authors of every age and language from whom I have derived the materials of this history and I am still convinced that the apparent ostentation would be more than compensated by real use If I have renounced this idea if I have declined an undertaking which had obtained the ap probation of a masterartistf my excuse may be found in the extreme difficulty of assigning a proper measure to such a catalogue A naked list of names and editions would not be satisfactory either to myself or my readers  the characters of the principal authors of the Roman and Byzantine History have been occasionally connected with the events which they describe a more copious and critical inquiry might indeed deserve but it would demand an elaborate volume which might swell by degrees into a general library of historical writers For the present I shall content myself with renew ing my serious protestation that I have always endeavoured to draw from the fountainhead that my curiosity as well as a sense of duty has always urged me to study the origi nals and that if they have sometimes eluded my search I  Alluding to the tfaarto edition in which size the work was originally published t See Dr Robertsons Preface to his History of America VOL v b IT PREFACE  have carefully marked the secondary evidence on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend I shall soon revisit the banks of the lake of Lausanne a country which I have known and loved from my early youth Under a mild government amidst a beauteous landscape in a life of leisure and independence and among a people of easy and elegant manners I have enjoyed and may again hope to enjoy the varied pleasures or retirement and society But I shall ever glory in the name and character of an Eng lishman I am proud of my birth in a free and enlightened country and the approbation of that country is the best and most honourable reward of my labours Were I ambitious of any other patron than the public I would inscribe this work to a Statesman who in a long a stormy and at length an unfortunate administration had many political opponents almost without a personal enemy who has retained in his fall from powermany faithful and disinterested friends and who under the pressure of severe infirmity enjoys the lively vigour of his mind and the felicity of his incomparable tem per Lord North will permit me to express the feelings of friendship in the language of truth but even truth and friendship should be silent if he still dispensed the favours of the crown   In a remote solitude vanity may still whisper in my ear that my readers perhaps may inquire whether in the con clusion of the present work I am now taking an everlasting farewell They shall hear all that I know myself all that I could reveal to the most intimate friend The motives of action or silence are now equally balanced nor can  pro nounce in my most secret thoughts on which side the scale will preponderate I cannot dissemble that six ample quartos must have tried and may have exhausted the indulgence of the Public that in the repetition of similar attempts a suc cessful author has much more to lose than he cart hope to gain that I am now descending into the vale of years and that the most respectable of my countrymen the men whom I aspire to imitate have resigned the pen of history about the same period of their lives Yet I consider that the an nals of ancient and modern times may afford many rich and interesting subjects that I am still possessed of health and leisure that by the practice of writing some skill and faci lity must be acquired and that in the ardent pursuit of PREFACE V truth and knowledge I am not conscious of decay To an active mind indolence is more painful than labour j and the first months of my liberty will be occupied and amused in the excursions of curiosity and taste By such temptations I have been sometimes seduced from the rigid duty even of a pleasing and voluntary task but my time will now be my own and in the use or abuse of independence I shall no longer fear my own reproaches or those of my friends I am fairly entitled to a year of jubilee next summer and the fol lowing winter will rapidly pass away and experience only can determine whether I shall stiH prefer the freedom and variety of study to the design and composition of a regular work which animates while it confines the daily applica tion of the author Caprice and accident may influence my choice but the dexterity of selflove will contrive to applaud either active industry or philosophic repose DowningSthbit May   P S I shall embrace this opportunity of introducing two verbal remarks which have not conveniently offered them selves to my notice  As often as I use the definitions of beydnd the Alps the Rhine the Danube cc I generally sup pose myself at Rome and afterward at Constantinople without observing whether this relative geography may agree with the local but variable situation of the reader or the historian  In proper names of foreign and especially of oriental origin it should be always our aim to express in our English version a faithful copy of the original But this rule which is founded on a just regard to uniformity and truth must often be relaxed and the exceptions will be li y mited or enlarged by the custom of the language and the taste of the interpreter Our alphabets may be often defec tive a harsh sound an uncouth spelling might offend the ear or the eye of our countrymen and some words notori ously corrupt are fixed and as it were naturalized in the vulgar tongue The prophet Mohammed can no longer be stripped of the famous though improper appellation of Ma homet the wellknown cities of Aleppo Damascus and Cairo would almost be lost in the strange descriptions of Haleb Damashk and Al Cahii a the titles and offices of the PREFACE Ottoman empire are fashioned by the practice of three hun dred years and we are pleased to blend the three Chinese monosyllables Conftttzee in the respectable name of Con fucius or even to adopt the Portuguese corruption of Man darin But I would vary the use of Zoroaster and Zerdusht as I drew my information from Greece or Persia since our connexion with India the genuine Timwr is restored to the throne of Tamerlane our most correct writers have re trenched the Al the superfluous article from the Koran and we escape an ambiguous termination by adopting Mos lem instead of Mussulman in the plural number In these and in a thousand examples the shades of distinction are often minute and I can feel where I cannot explain the motives of my choice  At the end of the History the reader will find a general

the news of his victory reach ed the distant camp of his brother in the same auspicious moment that the favourite concubine of Theodemir was delivered of a son and heir In the eighth year of his age Theodoric was reluctantly yielded by his father to the public interest as the pledge of an alliance which Leo emperor of the east had consented to purchase by an annual subsidy of three hundred pounds of gold The royal hostage was educated at Constantinople with care and tenderness His body was formed to all the exer cises of war his mind was expanded by the habits of li beral conversation he frequented the schools of the most skilful masters but he disdained or neglected the arts of Greece and so ignorant did he always remain of the first elements of science that a rude mark was con trived to represent the signature of the illiterate king of Italy As soon as he attained the age of eighteen he was restored to the wishes of the Ostrogoths whom the emperor  aspired to gain by liberality and confidence Walamir had fallen in battle the youngest of the bro thers Widimir had led away into Italy and Gaul an army of barbarians and the whole nation acknowledged for their king the

distress by the want of clothing and food They unanimously resolved to desert their Pannonian encampments and boldly to advance into the warm and wealthy neighbourhood of the Byzantine court which

worthless and ungrateful servant on whom she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the east As soon as she sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno he fled with precipitation into the mountains of Isauria and her brother Basiliscus already infamous by his Afri can expedition was unanimously proclaimed by the ser vile senate But the reign of the usurper was short and turbulent Basiliscus presumed to

fertile estates became barren in their hands they despised but they envied the la borious provincials and when their subsistence had failed the Ostrogoths embraced the familiar resources of war and rapine It had been the wish of Theodoric such at least was his dejaration to lead a peaceable obscure obedient life on the confines of Scythia till the Byzan tine court by splendid and fallacious promises seduced him to attack a confederate tribe of Goths who had been engaged in the party of Basilisqus He marched from his station in Maesia on the solemn assurance that be fore he reached Adrianople he should meet a plentiful convoy of provisions and a reinforcement of eight thou sand horse and thirty thousand foot while the legions of Asia were encamped at Heraclea to second his opera

were exposed in their frozen huts to intolerable hardships while their king was dissolved in the luxury of Greece and he prevented the painful alternative of encountering the Goths as the champion or of leading them to the field as the enemy f Zeno Embracing an enterprise wor thy of his courage and ambition Theodoric addressed the emperor in the following words Although your servant is main tained

divine permission I succeed I shall govern in your name and to your glory the Roman se nate and the part of the republic delivered from slavery by my victorious arms The proposal of Theodoric was accepted and perhaps had been suggested by the Byzan tine court But the forms of the commission or grant appear to have been expressed with a prudent ambiguity which might be explained by the event

the Gothic swarms already engaged in the service or seated in the provinces of the empire and each bold barbarian who had heard of the wealth and beauty of Italy was impatient to seek through the most perilous adventures the possession of such enchant ing objects The march of Theodoric must be consi dered as the emigration of an entire people the wives and children of the Goths their aged parents and most precious effects were carefully transported and some idea may be formed of the heavy baggage that now fol lowed the camp by the loss of two thousand waggons which had been sustained in a single action in the war of Epirus For their subsistence the Goths depended on the magazines of corn which was ground in portable mills by the hands of their women on the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds on the casual produce of the chase and upon the contributions which they might im pose on all who should presume to dispute the passage or to refuse their friendly assistance Notwithstanding these precautions they were exposed to the danger and almost to the distress of famine in a march of seven hundred miles which had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter Since the fall of the Roman power Dacia and Pannonia no longer exhibited the rich pros pect of populous cities wellcultivated fields and conve nient highways the reign of barbarism and desolation was restored and the tribes of Bulgarians Gepidas and Sarmatians who had occupied the vacant province were prompted by their native fierceness or the solicitations of Odoacer to resist the progress of his enemy In many obscure though bloody battles Theodoric fought and vanquished till at length surmounting every ob stacle by skilful conduct and persevering courage he de scended from the Julian Alps and

and refreshment to his wearied cavalry than he boldly attacked the fortifications of the enemy the Os trogoths shewed more ardour to acquire than the mer cenaries to defend the lands of Italy and the reward of the first victory was the possession of the Venetian pro vince as far as the walls of Verona In the neighbour hood of that city on the steep banks of the rapid Adige he was opposed by a new army reinforced in its num bers and not impaired in its courage the contest was more obstinate but the event was still more decisive Odoacer fled to Ravenna Theodoric advanced to Milan and the vanquished troops saluted their conqueror with loud acclamations of respect and fidelity But their want either of constancy or of faith soon exposed him to the most imminent danger his vanguard with se veral Gothic counts which had been rashly intrusted to a deserter was betrayed and destroyed near Faenza by his double treachery Odoacer again appeared master of the field and the invader strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia was reduced to solicit the aid of a kindred nation the Visigoths of Gaul In the course of the history the most voracious appetite for war will be abun dantly satiated

public justice The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the infirmities of nature and the imperfections of society and the mild est form of a Gothic kingdom even the weight of alle giance and gratitude must be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot But the favour and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the pubKc happiness and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and control the power of the master of the of fices In the last gloomy season of Theodoric he indig nantly felt that he was a slave but as his master had only power over his life he stood without arms

his nephew with the purple the pa triarch of Constantinople placed the diadem on the heads of the emperor and empress of the east But the usual honours which the severity of Roman manners had allowed to the wives of princes could not satisfy either the ambition of Theodora or the fondness of Justinian He seated her on the throne as an equal and independent colleague in the sovereignty of the empire and an oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors of the pro vinces in the joint names of Justinian and Theodora The eastern world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the daughter of Acacius The prostitute who in ths presence of innumerable spectators had pol luted the theatre of Constantinople was adored as a queen in the same city by grave magistrates orthodox

and the throne and fear as well as ambition might exasperate Theodora against two generals who during a malady of the emperor had rash ly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce in the choice of the capital But the reproach of cruelty so repugnant even to her softer vices has left an indelible stain on the memory of Theodora Her numerous spies observed and zealously reported every action or word or look injurious to their royal mistress Whom soever they accused were cast into her peculiar prisons inaccessible to the inquiries of justice and it was ru moured that the torture of the rack or scourge had been inflicted in the presence of a female tyrant insen sible to the voice of prayer or of pity Some of these unhappy victims perished in deep unwholesome dun geons while

to her speculative errors The name of Theodora was introduced with equal honour in all the pious and charitable foundations of Justinian  and the most bene volent institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy of the empress for her less fortunate sisters who had been seduced or compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution A palace on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus was converted into a stately and spacious mo nastery and a liberal maintenance was assigned to five hundred women who had been collected from the streets and brothels of Constantinople In this safe and holy retreat they were devoted to perpetual confinement and the despair of some who threw themselves headlong into the sea was lost in the gratitude of the penitents who had been delivered from sin and misery by their gene rous benefactress The prudence of Theodora is cele brated by Justinian himself and his laws are attributed to the sage counsels of his most reverend wife whom he had received as the gift of the Deity Her courage was displayed amidst the tumult of the people and the terrors of the court Her chastity from the moment of her union with Justinian is founded on the silence of

attempted to sow the seeds of discord between the emperor and his beloved consort Even Theodora herself was constrained to dissemble to wait a favourable moment and by an artful conspiracy to render John of Cappadocia the ac complice of his own destruction At a time when Beli sarius unless he had been a hero must have shewn him self a rebel his wife Antonina who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia the daughter of the prefect the credulous virgin imparted to her father the dan gerous project and John who might have known the value of oaths and promises was tempted to accept a nocturnal and almost treasonable interview with the wife of Belisarius An ambuscade of guards and eu nuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora they rushed with drawn swords to seize or punish the guilty minister he was saved by the fidelity of his at tendants but instead of appealing to a gracious sove reign who had privately warned him of his danger he pusillanimously fled to the sanctuary of the church The favourite of Justinian was sacrificed to conjugal tenderness or domestic tranquillity the conversion of a prefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes but the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace and he retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus an ample portion of hi riches Such imperfect revenge could not

emperor to recal a servant whom he had abandoned with regret the am bition of John of Cappadocia was reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession His successors con vinced the subjects of

an infirm old man peaceably to end his days either on the throne of Carthage or in the pa lace of Constantinople The passions or even the pru dence of Gelimer compelled him to reject these requests which were urged in the haughty tone of menace and command and he justified his ambition in a language rarely spoken in the Byzantine court by alleging the right of a free people to remove or punish

that before their army reached Tricameron about twenty miles from Carthage CHAP XLI OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE they might boast perhaps with some exaggeration that they surpassed in a tenfold proportion the

bearing arms for the defence of their country and religion The prudence of Belisarius did not neglect this important resource His soldiers were relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people who

while the soldiers chanted his name and victory the hostile en gines of war were reduced to ashes Such was the loss and consternation of the Goths that from this day the siege of Rome degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade and they were incessantly harassed by the Ro man general who in frequent skirmishes destroyed above five thousand of their bravest troops Their ca valry was unpractised

prognostics of death or recovery The order of funerals and the right of sepulchres were confounded those who were left without friends or servants lay unburied in the Streets or in their desolate

disdain the ob servation of Procopius that the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or providence He forgot or perhaps he secretly recollected that the plague had touched the person of Justinian himself but the abstemious diet of the emperor may suggest as in the case of Socrates a more rational and honourable cause for his recovery During his sickness the public

physicians in the care of the sick whom inhuman prudence would have condemned to solitude and despair But the fatal security like the predestination of the Turks must have aided the progress of the contagion and those salutary precautions to which Europe is indebted for her safety were unknown to the government of Justinian No restraints were im posed on the free and frequent intercourse of the Roi man provinces from Persia to France the nations were mingled and infected by wars and emigrations and the pestilential odour which lurks for years in a bale of cot ton was imported by the abuse of

tribunal of the people But a wild demo cracy superior to the forms too often disdains the es sential principles of justice the pride of despotism was envenomed by plebeian envy and the heroes of Athens might sometimes applaud the happiness of the Persian whose fate depended on the caprice of a single tyrant Some salutary restraints imposed by the people on their own passions were at once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the Romans The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates A vote of the thirtyfive tribes could inflict a fine but the cogni sance of all natural crimes was reserved by a fundamental law to the assembly of the centuries in which the weight of influence and property was sure to preponderate Re peated proclamations and adjournments were interposed to allow time for prejudice and resentment to subside the whole proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen or the opposition of a tribune and such popular trials were commonly less formidable to innocence than they were favourable to guilt But this union of the judi cial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the ac cused party was pardoned or acquitted and in the defence of an illustrious client the orators of Rome and Athens addressed their arguments to the policy and benevolence as well as to the justice of their sovereign  The task of convening the citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult as the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied and the ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the people to the ordinary magistrates or to extraordinary inquisitors In the first ages these questions were rare and occasional In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they were made perpetual for praetors were annually em powered to sit in judgment on the state offences of trea son extortion peculation and bribery  and Sylla added new praetors and new questions for those crimes which more directly injure the safety of individuals By these DECLINE AND FALL CHAP XLIV inquisitors the trial was prepared and directed but they could only pronounce the sentence of the majority of judges who with some truth and more prejudice have been compared to the English juries To discharge this important though burdensome office an annual list of ancient and respectable citizens was formed by the prae tor After many constitutional struggles they were chosen in equal numbers from the senate the equestrian order and the people four hundred and fifty were ap pointed for single questions and the various rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans who represented the judicial autho rity of the state In each particular cause a sufficient number was drawn from the urn their integrity was guarded by an oath the mode of ballot secured their independence the suspicion of partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and defendant and the judges of Milo by the retrenchment of fifteen on each side were reduced to fiftyone voices or tablets of acquittal of condemnation or of favourable doubt  In his civil jurisdiction the praetor of the city was truly a judge and almost a legislator but as soon as he had prescribed the action of law he often referred to a dele gate the determination of the fact With the increase of legal proceedings the tribunal of the centumvirs in which he precided acquired more weight and reputation But whether he acted alone or with the advice of his council the most absolute powers might be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of the people The rules and precautions of freedom have re quired some explanation the order of despotism is simple and inanimate Before the age of Justinian or perhaps of The office both at Rome and in England must be considered as an occasional duty and not a magistracy or profession But the obligation of a unanimous verdict is peculiar to our laws which condemn the jurymen to undergo the torture from whence they have exempted the criminal We are indebted for this interesting fact to a fragment of Asconins Pedianns who flourished under the

had been legally proved his innocence was presumed and his person was free till the votes of the last century had been counted and declared he might peaceably secede to any of the allied cities of Italy or Greece or Asia His fame and fortunes were preserv ed at least to his children by this civil death and he might still be happy in every rational and sensual enjoy ment if a mind accustomed to the ambitious tumult of Romecould support the uniformity and silence of Rhodes or Athens A bolder effort was required to escape from the tyranny of the Caesars but this effort was rendered familiar by the maxims of the Stoics the examples of the bravest Romans and the legal encouragements of suicide The bodies of condemned criminals were ex posed to public ignominy and their children a more serious evil were reduced to poverty by the confiscation of their fortunes But if the victims of Tiberius and Nero anticipated the decree of the prince or senate their courage and dispatch were recompensed by the applause of the public the decent honours of burial and the vali dity of their testaments The exquisite avarice and cruelty of Domitian appear to have deprived the unfor tunate of this last

Tiber In a period of thirteen hundred years the laws had reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners and the laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent institutions destroyed the harmony and swelled the magnitude of the obscure and irregular system The laws which excuse on any occa sions the ignorance of their subjects confess their own imperfections the civil jurisprudence as it was abridged by Justinian still continued a mysterious science and a profitable trade and the innate perplexity of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by the private industry of the practitioners The expense of the pursuit some times exceeded the value of the prize and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty or prudence of the claimants Such costly justice might tend to abate the spirit of litigation but the unequal pressure serves only to increase the influence of the rich and to aggravate the misery of the poor By these dilatory and expensive

Alboin returned in triumph and the Lombards who celebrated his matchless intrepidity were compelled to praise the virtues of an enemyIn this extraordinary visit he had probably seen the daughter of

nations and the personal adversaries of the chagan If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should unite in this glorious quarrel the victory was secure and the reward inestimable the Danube the Hebrus Italy and Con stantinople would be exposed without a barrier to their invincible arms But if they hesitated or delayed to pre vent the malice of the Romans the same spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars to the extremity of the earth These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness and disdain he detained the Lom bard ambassadors in his camp protracted the negotiation and by turns alleged his want of inclination or his want of ability to undertake this important enterprise At length he signified the ultimate price of his alliance that the Lombards should immediately present him with the tithe of their cattle that the spoils and captives should be equally divided but that the lands of the Gepidae should become the sole patrimony of the Avars Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the passions of Alboin and as the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude and perfidy of the Gepidae Justin abandoned that incorrigible people to their fate and remained the tranquil spectator of this unequal conflict The despair of Cunimund was active and dangerous He was inform ed that the Avars had entered his confines but on the CHAP XLV OF

But the courage of the Gepidas could se cure them no more than an honourable death The bravest of the nation fell in the field of battle the king of the Lombards contemplated with delight the head of Cunimund and his skull was fashioned into a cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror or perhaps to com ply with the savage custom of his countryk After this victory no farther obstacle could impede the progress of the confederates and they faithfully executed the terms of their agreement The fair countries of Walachia Moldavia Transylvania and the parts of Hungary be yond the Danube were occupied without resistance by a new colony of Scvthians and the Dacian empire of the chagans subsisted with splendour above two hundred and thirty years The nation of the Gepidse was dis solved but in the distribution of the captives the slaves of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the Lombards whose generosity adopted a valiant foe and whose freedom was incompatible with cool and deli berate tyranny One moiety of the spoil introduced in to the camp of Alboin more wealth than a barbarian could readily compute The fair Rosamond was per suaded or compelled to acknowledge the

and Alemanni In the second they were vanquished in a bloody battle with more loss and dishonour than they had sustained since the foundation of their monarchy Impatient for revenge they returned a third time with accumulated force and Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent The troops and treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled towns between the Alps and the Apennine A nation less sensible of danger than of fatigue and delay soon murmured against the folly of their twenty commanders and the hot vapours of an Italian sun infected with disease those tramontane bodies which had already suffered the vicissitudes of in temperance and famine The powers that were inade quate to the conquest were more than sufficient for the desolation of the country nor could the trembling na tives distinguish between their enemies and their deliver ers If the junction of the Merovingian and imperial forces had been effected in the neighbourhood of Milan perhaps they might have subverted the throne of the Lombards but the Franks expected six days the signal of a flaming village and the arms of the Greeks were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma which were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine allies The victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the dominion of Italy At the foot of the Rhae tian Alps he subdued the resistance and rifled the hidden treasures of a sequestered island in the lake of Comum CHAP XLV OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  At the extreme point of Calabria he touched with his spear a column on the seashore of Rhegium proclaiming that ancient land mark to stand the immoveable boun dary of his kingdom During a period of two hundred years Italy was un J equally divided between the kingdom of the Lombards Ravenna and

Corsica and Sicily still adhered to the empire and the acquisition of the farther Calabria removed the landmark of Autharis from the shore of Rhegium to the isthmus of Consentia In Sardinia the savage mountaineers preserved the liberty and religion of their ancestors but the husbandmen of Sicily were chained to their rich and cultivated soil Rome was oppressed by the iron sceptre of the exarchs and a Greek perhaps an eunuch insulted with impunity the ruins of the Capitol But Naples soon acquired the pri vilege of electing her own dukes the independence of Amalphi was the fruit of commerce and the voluntary attachment of Venice was finally ennobled by an equal alliance with the eastern empire On the map of Italy the measure of the exarchate occupies a very inadequate space but it included an ample proportion of wealth in dustry and population The most faithful and valuable subjects escaped from the barbarian yoke and the ban ners of Pavia and Verona of Milan and Padua were dis played

and sense to decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege The public revenue arose from the produce of land and the profits of justice When the independent dukes agreed that Autharis should as

and sect are the best entitled to such infernal abodes The glory of the house of Sassan ended with the life of Chosroes his un natural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crimes and in the space of four years the regal title was assumed by nine candidates who disputed with the sword or dagger the fragments of an exhausted mon archy Every province and each city of Persia was the scene of

true wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands of the successor of Constantine The victor was not ambitious of enlarging the weakness of the empire the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret the conquests of his father the Persians who eva cuated the cities of Syria and Egypt were honourably con ducted to the frontier and a war which had wounded the Vitals of the two monarchies produced no change in their external and relative situation The return of Heraclius from Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph and after the exploits of six glorious campaigns he peace ably enjoyed the sabbath of his toils After a long im patience the senate the clergy and the people went forth to meet their hero with tears and acclamations with olive branches and innumerable lamps he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by four elephants and as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from the tumult of pub lic joy he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the em braces of his mother and his son The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different kind the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre Heraclius performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem the identity of the relic was ve rified by the discreet patriarch and this august ceremony has been commemorated by the annual festival of the exaltation of the cross Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated ground he was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple the pomp and va nity of the world but in the judgment of his clergy the persecution of the Jews was more easily reconciled with the precepts of the gospel He again ascended his throne to receive the congratulations of the ambassadors of  The burden of Corneilles song Montrez Heraclius au people qui

eclipsed in the popular estimation by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius Yet the deliverer of the east was indigent and feeble Of the Persian spoils the most valuable portion had been ex pended in the war distributed to the soldiers or buried by an unlucky tempest in the waves of the Euxine The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the ob ligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy which he had borrowed for their own defence a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable creditors the provinces already wasted by the arms and avarice of the Persians were compelled to a second payment of the same taxes and the arrears of a simple citizen the trea surer of Damascus were commuted to a fine of one hun dred thousand pieces of gold The loss of two hundred thousand soldiers who had fallen by the sword was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts agriculture and population in this long and destructive war and although a victorious army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Je rusalem an obscure town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens and they cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief an ordinary and trifling occurrence had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution These robbers were the apostles of Maho met their fanatic valour had emerged from the desert and in the last eight years of his reign Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he
